This in an academic project developed in Digital Works of Synchronous Counter (J-K Flip-Flops)
The circuit simulator has a Synchronus Counter in it, where it has some conditions in it binary sequencial:

1. The Synchronos Counter need to follow this sequence: 0, 11, 1, 7, 12, 2, 9, 3, 14, 5 y 10.
2. When the sequence finish, it need to turn on the red led ligth, and reset the circuit.
